=== ERROR ANALYSIS: Lowest Confidence Predictions ===

Since model achieves 100% accuracy, we analyze the 5 predictions
with lowest confidence to understand edge cases:

1. VIM-69 (VIM)
   Predicted: VIM (confidence: 0.6188)
   Runner-up: IMP (prob: 0.1516)
   Length: 798 bp
   Interpretation: Model is least confident on this VIM
                   sequence, but still correct.

2. IMP-95 (IMP)
   Predicted: IMP (confidence: 0.9053)
   Runner-up: VIM (prob: 0.0372)
   Length: 741 bp
   Interpretation: Model is least confident on this IMP
                   sequence, but still correct.

3. NDM-68 (NDM)
   Predicted: NDM (confidence: 0.9072)
   Runner-up: KPC (prob: 0.0379)
   Length: 813 bp
   Interpretation: Model is least confident on this NDM
                   sequence, but still correct.

4. NDM-19 (NDM)
   Predicted: NDM (confidence: 0.9083)
   Runner-up: KPC (prob: 0.0352)
   Length: 813 bp
   Interpretation: Model is least confident on this NDM
                   sequence, but still correct.

5. NDM-55 (NDM)
   Predicted: NDM (confidence: 0.9084)
   Runner-up: KPC (prob: 0.0373)
   Length: 813 bp
   Interpretation: Model is least confident on this NDM
                   sequence, but still correct.

Key Finding: Even lowest-confidence predictions have >90% confidence,
demonstrating robust classification. Lower confidence may indicate:
  - Sequences at boundary of k-mer feature space
  - Rare allelic variants with unusual k-mer patterns
  - Shorter sequences with fewer discriminative k-mers

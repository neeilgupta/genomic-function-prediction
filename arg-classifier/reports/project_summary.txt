ARG FAMILY CLASSIFIER - PROJECT SUMMARY
========================================

Dataset:
- Source: CARD v4.0.1 (May 2025)
- Total sequences: 489
- Classes: KPC (230), NDM (71), VIM (89), IMP (99)
- Split: 342 train / 73 val / 74 test

Features:
- K-mer size: 5
- Vectorization: TF-IDF
- Feature dimensions: 1,023

Models:
- Baseline: K-mer Jaccard nearest neighbor
- ML Model: Logistic Regression (multinomial)

Results:
                Accuracy    Macro F1    Inference Time
Baseline        1.0000      1.0000      0.7s
ML Model        1.0000      1.0000      <0.01s

Key Findings:
1. Both models achieve perfect accuracy (reflects high similarity
   of allelic variants within families)
2. ML model is 70x faster than nearest-neighbor search
3. ML model requires only 1,023 coefficients (40KB) vs storing
   342 training sequences (270KB)
4. Model converged in 15 iterations (clear linear separability)
5. Lowest confidence prediction: VIM-69 at 0.6188 (still correct)
   — an outlier allele with unusual k-mer profile vs. family centroid

Value Propositions:
- Speed: Enable real-time pathogen identification
- Scalability: O(1) inference vs O(n) nearest-neighbor
- Deployment: Smaller memory footprint for edge devices
- Interpretability: Per-class probabilities for clinical decision support

Future Work:
- Cluster-based split (90% identity) for harder evaluation
- Expand to 15+ ARG families beyond carbapenemases
- Explore deep learning (CNN, Transformer) architectures
- Protein-space embeddings via ESM-2
